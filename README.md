# Description

Escape from Miss Calculator, unleashing nightmares in an abandoned school.

In the game 'Mathematic Teacher' you find yourself in an abandoned school turned into hell by Miss Calculator, a former math teacher. She left her students locked in a classroom after lessons, and then transformed the educational institution into a nightmarish labyrinth.

Hiding behind eerie hallways and horrifying classrooms, you must survive by solving her mathematical puzzles to unlock doors and escape this nightmare. Miss Calculator pursues you, using her dreadful abilities and turning mathematics into a deadly tool.

Confronting the ghosts of unsolved equations and ominous shadows of past lessons, you must use your intellect and agility to avoid her deadly traps. Danger lurks in every corner of the school, and only those who can unravel the secrets of Miss Calculator can escape this mathematical horror nightmare.
